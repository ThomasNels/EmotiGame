        <h1>Results of our study</h1>

        <p>
            To help analyze biometric differences in skill level, we employed various machine learning models 
            to classify participants based on heart rate and movement during specific gameplay events. We trained Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), 
            Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers on features that included participant heart rate, base heart rate, 
            actions per minute, and key event labels. By comparing model performance, we identified a correlation between 
            biometric indicators and player skill level. The LSTM model was particularly useful for capturing temporal 
            patterns in the features, offering insight into how players respond to different in-game situations. Overall, 
            the results suggest that biometric data can serve as an indicator of skill level in video game players and 
            provide a foundation for future research in this area.

        <p>This graph, figure 1, shows a side-by-side comparison of the APM of a participant versus the control player surring session 8. 
            The AMP is based on the erratic mouse movements, mouse clicks and keyboard clicks each person makes over 10 second intervals. 
            Additionally, the low and high importance events are labeled and during these events, the AMP of both people spikes.</p>

                <span class="tooltip">In this image, the data for skilled players ends roughly 10 seconds before the control and unskilled 
                    player's data. This is because sessions with skilled players were shorter in length then unskilled players.</span>
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>Figure 2 compares the mean actions per minute (AMP) among three groups: control, unskilled, and skilled. The skilled participants 
            have high AMP and the unskilled have the lowest. This contrast between the two can indicate that there is a performance gap tied 
            to their expertise.</p>

        <p>This graph, figure 3, compares mean heart rate across control, skilled, and unskilled groups during important events. The skilled 
            participants have the highest heart rate, then the control player. The lower heart rate of the unskilled participants could reflect 
            less investment in the game.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Table 1: Accuracy of the machine learning models used.</p>

        <p>Table 1 shows the performance of the machine learning models we used. Accuracy is the overall correctness of the model. 
            Precision is the proportion of correct classifications. Higher precision means fewer false positives. Recall is the ability 
            to correctly identify all instances of a given skill level. The higher the recall is, the fewer detections were missed. 
            F1 - Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced metric when both are implemented. As 
            seen in the table above, All of our models performed very well. They had a very good accuracy and provided a lot of insight 
            into our results.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Table 2: Statistical significance between skill level and biometric readings for different types of events.</p>

        <p>Table 2 shows the statistical significance for the relationship between skill level and biometric responses, like heart rate 
            or AMP, across in-game events of varying importance. A low p-value, typically less than 0.05, indicates that the observed 
            differences are statistically significant.</p>

        <p>After reading the values within table 2, we see that there is some statistical significance between AMP with high importance 
            events, as well as statistical significance between heart rate with low and high importance events. While we don't fully 
            understand how yet, table 2 shows that there is a correlation of skill level with AMP and heart rate.</p>
