        </h1>

        <p>
            One challenge in understanding skill in competitive gaming is what factors contribute to players skill 
            level. Is it possible to identify patterns in player behavior that reveal skill and cognitive load? EmotiGame 
            is a user research study exploring how biometric data can reveal patterns in gaming skill levels. Our user 
            study brings together 12 participants, 6 skilled and 6 unskilled, to compete in 1v1 League of Legends matches 
            against an expert control player.
        </p>

        <p>
            As participants play, we track heart rate, keyboard activity, and mouse movement to analyze physiological and 
            behavioral differences between skill levels. Using machine learning, we aim to uncover biometric indicators that 
            may distinguish experienced players from beginners.
